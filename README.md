The application is crafted to store your passwords. With this app you don't need to memorize or scribble your passwords on a piece of paper anymore. Moreover you can attach notes to your passwords to remember some details about a password. And whenever you need to use your password, all you need to do is copy and paste your password.

## Components

**Onboarding**, used to give information and instructions about the app to make most of it.

**CoreData**, used to store passwords and notes locally.

**Alerts**, used to notify about mistakes users can make on password entering progress.

**UIPasteboard**, used to copy and paste with a single click.

## How to Run

Downloading as a zip file is recommended not to meet Xcode related errors and problems.
