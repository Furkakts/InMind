The application is crafted to store your passwords. With this app you don't need to memorize or scribble your passwords on a piece of paper anymore. Moreover you can attach notes to your passwords to remember some details about password. And whenever you need to use your password, all you need to do is copy and paste it.

## Components

**Onboarding**, used to give information and instructions about the app to get the most out of it.

**CoreData**, used to store passwords and notes locally.

**UIPasteboard**, used to copy and paste with a single click.

## How to Run

Downloading as a zip file is recommended not to meet Xcode related errors and problems.
